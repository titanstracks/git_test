This is Titanâ€™s Tracks' first git project!

If you're reading this then go and check out my Youtube Channel - www.youtube.com/c/titanstracks
I post my music there as well as the 3D models I make in Blender!

Thanks for taking interest in my first git project, it means a lot to me! :) 

* I messed up the steps on this Odin Project thing, I was supposed to write this out in the README.md file, 
not this hello_world.txt file... oh well not like anyone is gonna read this!
